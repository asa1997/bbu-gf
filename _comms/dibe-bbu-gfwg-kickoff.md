Background Material
-----------------
A [single PDF](./presentations/stm-sbu-dibe-intro.pdf) covers three key introductory discussion points:
a) What are the tactical and strategic options for enterprises today to participate in collaborative efforts around the ToIP Stack (architecture).
b) What are the motivating factors within the Sovrin Community for a transition from a Single Ledger Utility to a Network of Ledgers (Network of Networks)?

>NOTE: GDPR/CCPA and CryptoToken risks are inhibitors for adoption around decentralized identity for enterprises. We need a tactical safe-zone!
c) How do we establish the necessary governance framework artifacts (business, legal, technical documents) necessary to launch a new business utility?

Proposal
-----------------
Create a new dedicate business identity utility where only members can exercise permissioned writes and the sustainability of the network is achieved through membership fees. This new identity utility, currently referred to as the Sovrin Business Utility (SBU), will be managed by a governing body called the Decentralized Identity Business Ecosystem (DIBE) Consortium. The DIBE Consortium will be comprised of members that initially fall into three categories: Founding, Steward, Trust Anchors. Only Founding Members will have a seat on the Board of Directors and only prospective Founding Members will have the opportunity to define the initial version of the DIBE Governance Framework. The DIBE Consortium will outsource the operation and maintenance of the SBU to the Sovrin Foundation.

Approach
-----------------
1. Consortium Building Phase (4Q19)

	1. Exploratory Sessions for prospective members.
	2. Prospective Founding Members nominate executive sponsor and consortium associate.

2. Governance Framework Phase (1Q20)
	1. Solicitation for additional Founding Members is ongoing.
	2. Governance Framework Workgroup (GFWG), comprised of nominated Consortium Associates, will gather twice a week for 6-8 weeks over Zoom Mtgs to create the Governance Framework documents required to launch the DIBE Consortium.
		* Collaborate with Sovrin Leadership on Sovrin Foundation Services & Costs.
		* Leverage GitHub and open source Markdown documents to establish and host the DIBE Governance Framework documents.
  3. Formal proposal from the GFWG to Executive Sponsors of the DIBE Governance Framework.

3. Execution Phase (2Q20)

  1. Announce DIBE Consortium in conjunction with Sovrin Foundation.
	2. Create DIBE Board of Directors (formalization of Founding members via signing of agreements).
	3. Ongoing campaign for adding Stewards and Trust Anchors.
	4. Members (Founding, Stewards) create the Sovrin Business Utility (DID Ledger)

Required Action
-----------------
Prospective Founding Members need to nominate with name and email your firms candidates for:

* Executive Sponsor: Expected representative on the Board of Directors
* Consortium Associate: DIBE Governance Framework Workgroup Participate. Candidates should have both business and technical acumen in the decentralized identity area plus have the ability to comfortably work in Github with markdown documents.  

The DIBE Governance Framework Workgroup will begin activities next week. The task at hand is to create a new set of control documents that derived from the initial work by Sovrin as available [here](https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/)

>**Note**: Until a formal Agreement is reached with each prospective member and the DIBE Consortium status in the Consortium is considered prospective. Therefore, it is imperative to create a Governance Framework comprised of business, legal, technical documents so that the formalization of the Board of Directors and Membership status can be achieved.
