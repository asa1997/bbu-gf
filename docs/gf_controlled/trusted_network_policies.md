## Network Trust Perspective
The Bedrock Consortium strives to establish and position ledgers, such as the Bedrock Business Utility, to be reliable and trusted ledgers for businesses seeking to perform decentralized identifier verification tasks. However, each entity operating in the roles of issuer or verifier MUST arrive at their own independent determination of a trusted identity network.

## General Trust Policies
The Governing Board for the Bedrock Consortium WILL work with the ToIP Ecosystem Foundry Working Group to help position the Bedrock Business Utility as a trusted utility for use by ecosystem projects.
