## Core Principles
Unless otherwise noted, the BBU-GF is aligned with the principles outlined in ```Section 2``` of the [Sovrin Governance Framework Master Document Version 2](https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Governance-Framework-V2-Master-Document-V1.pdf).

**April 2020**: Since the Sovrin Foundation is admits a transition to the ToIP Foundation, elements of the Master Document need to be extracted and captured for reuse within the ToIP FOundation. See [BBU Issue 11](https://github.com/bedrock-consortium/bbu-gf/issues/11).
