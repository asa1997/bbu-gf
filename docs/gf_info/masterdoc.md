## Introduction
The Bedrock Governance Framework (BGF) serves as the *constitution* for the *Bedrock Business Utility*. The BGF (also referred to as "BBU-GF") is a specialized Domain-Specific Governance Frameworks (DSGFs) as described in the [Sovrin ToIP Metasystem Governance Framework (STM-GF) Master Document](https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Governance-Framework-V2-Master-Document-V1.pdf).

The BGF leverages the principles, policies, terminology, and standards defined in the STM-GF to enable trusted digital commerce based on decentralized identity.

A key objective of the BGF is to address any concerns or risks that Consortium members may have with participation compliance with Data Protection Regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).

The BGF formally consists of a set of interrelated documents that collectively forms the governance model for the Consortium and the DID Ledger (`did:sov:biz`) that the Consortium manages. The documents are organized in three (3) categories; Blue = Normative, Yellow = Assessment, White = Informative.

## Purpose
The purpose of the Bedrock Business Utility is to provide a decentralized global public utility for trusted commerce. It is one of many possible DID Ledgers ("Peer-Nets").

The purpose of the Bedrock Governance Framework (BGF) is to define the business, legal, and technical policies for the Bedrock Business Utility.

The purpose of the Bedrock Consortium is to administer decentralized governance for Bedrock Business Utility.

## Core Principles
Unless otherwise noted, the Bedrock Governance Framework (BGF) is aligned with the principles outlined in the [STM-GF Master Document](https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Governance-Framework-V2-Master-Document-V1.pdf).

## Core Polices
In keeping with all Core Principles and especially the Decentralization by Design and Security by Design principles:

1. Policies, practices, procedures, and algorithms governing participation of Stewards and operation of Nodes MUST follow all Core Principles.
2. The Consortium MUST publish the following Controlled Documents managed as specified by Bedrock Governing Bodies:​
a. Member Business Policies
b. Member Technical Policies​
c. Ledger Access Policies

###​ Guardianship
In keeping with the Guardianship principle, a Guardian SHOULD:

1. Act in the Dependent person’s best interest.
2. Exercise good judgment and carefully manage responsibilities.
3. Avoid commingling—keep Dependent’s property separate (e.g., separate DIDs, Public
Keys, Wallets, Vaults, etc.).
4. Keep detailed records of all actions taken on behalf of the Dependent.
5. Not violate the Anti-Impersonation principle (section 2.11.5).
6. Be subject to applicable legal structures regarding the granting and revocation of Guardianships.
​
### Inclusion
In keeping with the Inclusive by Design principles but in recognition of the permissioned write structure of the Bedrock Business Utility:

1. Read access to the Bedrock Business Utility MUST be open to all types of entities.  
2. Write access will be limited to members in good standing within the consortium.

### Trust Assurance
In keeping with all Core Principles and especially the Decentralization by Design principles:

1. The Consortium MUST specify policies, practices, and procedures for assessing conformance to the Bedrock Governance Framework by publishing and maintaining the Bedrock Trust Assurance Framework​ ​as a Controlled Document managed as specified by Sovrin Governing Bodies​. The Controlled Documents may leverage the services and guidance of the Sovrin Trust Assurance Framework​.
2. The Bedrock Consortium MUST publish the Bedrock Trust Mark Policies​ ​as a Controlled Document managed as specified by Bedrock Governing Bodies.​ The Consortium may decide to leverage instead the Trust Mark Policies but a Bedrock Controlled Document must specify such a decision/policy.
3. An Entity serving in one of the Sovrin Network who meets the requirements in the Bedrock Trust Assurance Framework MAY use the appropriate Bedrock Trust Mark as specified in Bedrock Trust Mark Policies​.

## Economics
In keeping with the Sustainability principle:

1. The Consortium  MUST publish the ​Bedrock Economic Policies​ ​as a Controlled Document managed as specified by Bedrock Governing Bodies​ in conjunction with Consortium legal counsel.
2. The Consortium MUST manage Ledger Fees and any mechanism used for paying them to ensure economic viability and sustainability for the Consortium to keep with its charter as a non-profit public trust organization.
3. The Consortium MUST retain a qualified Auditor to publish an annual public audit of Consortium finances.

## Governance
The Bedrock Governance Framework Master Document and the Controlled Documents listed in Appendix A shall be revised from time to time. The policies in this section govern this process.

Unless otherwise noted, the Bedrock Governance Framework (BGF) will adhere to the same procedures for managing document lifecycles as outlined in Section 4 of the [STM-GF Master Document](https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Governance-Framework-V2-Master-Document-V1.pdf).

All Bedrock Governance Framework documents will reside in a Github source control repository and will use the associated Issue Tracker for change management.

## Appendix A: Controlled Documents
The following Controlled Documents are normative components of the Bedrock Governance Framework V1. All framework documents are published by the Consortium in two forms:

1. A static PDF document representing the current approved version.  A link is always available via the ​Github repo and the table below.
2. A sub-section of the [Sovrin](http://sovrin.org) website so that all documentation is easily navigated.  

### Issues / Comments
A Github source control repository and will use the repo's Issue Tracker for change management.
