The term “Bedrock” carries two pertinent meanings:

1. Gold accumulates at this solid foundational layer of the earth because water can't "wash it down" any further. The implication here is that our public identity utility ledger is the bedrock for business trust worldwide.
2. A “bedrock” principle is one that forms the basis for others principles. Our public identity utility ledger aims to provide the foundational principles for the exchange of trusted personal data.
