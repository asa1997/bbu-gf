### Consortium Name
Participants in the Directed Fund are members of the Bedrock Consortium. Our membership shares a keen interest towards the establishment of trusted commerce. They believe in a set of fundamental privacy by design principles while mitigating financial and regulatory compliance risks.

The term “Bedrock” carries two pertinent meanings:

1. Gold accumulates at this solid foundational layer of the earth because water can't "wash it down" any further. The implication here is that our public identity utility ledger is the bedrock for business trust worldwide.
2. A “bedrock” principle is one that forms the basis for others principles. Our public identity utility ledger aims to provide the foundational principles for the exchange of trusted personal data.

## Governing Board
The Consortium will appoint a Governing Board as the governing body of the Directed Fund. The Governing Board will be comprised of representatives from membership as outlined in "Exhibit B" of the Bedrock Business Utility Fund Charter.
