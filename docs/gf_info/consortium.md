The **Bedrock Consortium** ("Consortium") is an international non-profit association of members that share a common interest in collaborating on the delivery of the infrastructure and governance necessary for a dedicated and trusted public identity utility based on decentralized identity technology. The utility is intended to reliably serve the verifiability of both physical and online digital identity interactions. The Consortium is focused on the governance of a dedicated decentralized identity utility for the exchange fo trusted data. The Consortium represents a formal Trust Community consisting of participating members that adhere to the *Bedrock Business Utility Governance Framework* ("BBU-GF").

### Consortium Name
Participants in the Directed Fund are members of the Bedrock Consortium. Our membership shares a keen interest towards the establishment of trusted commerce. They believe in a set of fundamental privacy by design principles while mitigating financial and regulatory compliance risks.

The term “Bedrock” carries two pertinent meanings:

1. Gold accumulates at this solid foundational layer of the earth because water can't "wash it down" any further. The implication here is that our public identity utility ledger is the bedrock for business trust worldwide.
2. A “bedrock” principle is one that forms the basis for others principles. Our public identity utility ledger aims to provide the foundational principles for the exchange of trusted personal data.

## Board of Directors
The Consortium will appoint a Board of Directors ("BoD") as the governing body of the Directed Fund. The BoD will be comprised of representatives from membership as outlined in "Exhibit B" of the Bedrock Business Utility Fund Charter. See [BBU Partnership Agreement](../gf_legal/contracts/bbu_partnership_agreement.docx).

## Bylaws
The BoD is responsible for establishing and maintaining the governance framework for the operation and administration of the *Bedrock Business Utility ("BBU")* along with the bylaws for the Consortium. See [BBU Partnership Agreement](../gf_legal/contracts/bbu_partnership_agreement.docx).
