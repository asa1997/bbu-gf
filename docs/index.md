The *Bedrock Consortium* is a collection of international private sector companies that operate the *Bedrock Business Utility (BBU)*, an independent self-governed non-profit legal entity that serves as a public identity utility and operates as a self-sustainable directed fund project under [The Linux Foundation](http://linuxfoundation.org/).

<p align="center"><img src="./img/consortium-logo.png" alt="logo" height="150" width="300"></p>

The BBU is intended to serve organizations that desire to participate in [digital trust ecosystems](./gf_info/glossary.md) and require an enterprise grade governance framework that will:

* Enforce permissioned-writes with contractual instruments that will conform to privacy regulations such as GDPR
* Maintain financial sustainability of the consortium members without the use of cryptographic tokens
* Establish a governing board so that no single organization owns the [Identity Utility Network](./gf_info/glossary.md)
* Require adherences to a specified open standards and protocols

To meet these requirements, the BBU operates as a *Linux Foundation Operational Project* (a Delaware series limited liability company) under its own governance framework. Consortium members pay annual membership fees and provide supporting infrastructure to maintain a sustainable permissioned identity utility that is structured as an enterprise safe-space and purpose built for trusted commerce. The consortium leverages an independent [Utility Service Provider](./gf_info/glossary.md) as a fee-based administrator for the delivery of a [DID Ledger](./gf_info/glossary.md) associated with a unique DID Root Namespace, ```did:bbu```.

This document serves as the *constitution* for the BBU and represents the official BBU Governance Framework (BBU-GF).

The governing body responsible for the BBU-GF is the *Governing Board*.
