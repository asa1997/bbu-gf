The *Bedrock Consortium* is a collection of international private sector companies that operate the *Bedrock Business Utility (BBU)*, an independent self-governed non-profit legal entity that serves as a public identity utility and operates as a self-sustainable directed fund project under [The Linux Foundation](http://linuxfoundation.org/).

The BBU is intended to serve as a safe-zone for organizations that desire to participate in [digital trust ecosystems](LINK TO ToIP DEFINITION) but require an enterprise grade governance framework that will:

* Enforce permissioned-writes with contractual instruments that will ease GDPR concerns
* Establish financial sustainability of the consortium members without the use of cryptographic tokens
* Establish a governing board so that no single organization owns the [Identity Utility Network](./gf_info//glossary.md)
* Require adherences to a specific stack of open standards and protocols

To meet these requirements, the BBU operates as a *Linux Foundation Operational Project* (a Delaware series limited liability company) under its own governance framework. Consortium members pay annual membership fees and provide supporting infrastructure to maintain a sustainable permissioned identity utility that is structured as an enterprise safe-space and purpose built for trusted commerce. The consortium leverages an independent [Utility Service Provider](./gf_info//glossary.md) as a fee-based administrator for the delivery of a [DID Ledger](./gf_info//glossary.md) associated with a unique DID Root Namespace (*did:bbu*).

This document serves as the *constitution* for the BBU and represents the official BBU Governance Framework (BBU-GF).

The governing body responsible for the BBU-GF is the *Board of Directors (BoD)*.
